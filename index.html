        This paper discusses the functions of downforce and drag, the compromises engineers must make, and significance of components that
        contribute to the aerodynamic make of the car, such as like airfoils, which aid in maximizing aerodynamic efficiency. The paper 
        also delves into idea of the angle of attack, and how it can affect drag and downforce, showing how In order to balance the conflicting
        needs of cornering and straight line speed, a versatile aerodynamic configuration is essential for optimizing performance to certain tracks

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

  <pre>
    Aerodynamics is one of the most pivotal considerations for engineers when designing a Formula 1 car, as it governs the behaviour of airflow
    around the vehicle. Which significantly influences the carâ€™s handling characteristics, particularly its grip and stability through corners,
    as well as its ability to achieve optimal straight-line speed. The part that depicts majority of the airflow onto the rest of the car is
    the wing, guiding the air onto the wheels and sidepods. Effective aerodynamic design in this area involves maximizing downforce to enhance
    cornering performance while minimizing drag to reduce resistance and improve overall speed. Balancing these competing aerodynamic forces
    is crucial for achieving competitive performance.

        Drag is considered the force that opposes the motion of a body. In a study by Pandit, A. & Day, G. (2021), it was mentioned that drag
        can be produced in two ways, Friction and Pressure. In the case of an F1 car, the chassis collides with air particles at speed,
        which cause an opposing motion leading to the car needing to generate more thrust to maintain velocity. This is called aerodynamic drag
        which occurs naturally, and teams will design their cars to counter this effect to lose minimal time on the straights,
        the other type of drag is induced, meaning it is created because of the teams own aerodynamic concepts applied ot the car.
        As mentioned by Pandit, A. & Day, G. (2021), its created by a pressure difference between the two ends of the body, as force acts from an area
        of high pressure to an area of low pressure.
