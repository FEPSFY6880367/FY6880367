<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
    This paper discusses the functions of downforce and drag, the compromises engineers must make, and the significance of components that
    contribute to the aerodynamic makeup of the car, such as airfoils, which aid in maximizing aerodynamic efficiency. The paper also delves
    into the idea of the angle of attack and how it can affect drag and downforce, showing how balancing the conflicting needs of cornering
    and straight-line speed is essential for optimizing performance on certain tracks.
</p>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p id="Introduction_InText" class="ex1">
    Aerodynamics is one of the most pivotal considerations for engineers when designing a Formula 1 car, as it governs the behavior of airflow
    around the vehicle. This significantly influences the car’s handling characteristics, particularly its grip and stability through corners,
    as well as its ability to achieve optimal straight-line speed. The wing guides the majority of the airflow onto the rest of the car, such as
    the wheels and sidepods. Effective aerodynamic design in this area involves maximizing downforce to enhance cornering performance while
    minimizing drag to reduce resistance and improve overall speed. Balancing these competing aerodynamic forces is crucial for achieving
    competitive performance.
</p>

<h3 id="Analysis-and-discussion">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
<p id="Analysis_InText" class="ex1">
    Drag is considered the force that opposes the motion of a body. In a study by Pandit, A. & Day, G. (2021), it was mentioned that drag can
    be produced in two ways: friction and pressure. In the case of an F1 car, the chassis collides with air particles at speed, causing an
    opposing motion and requiring the car to generate more thrust to maintain velocity. This is called aerodynamic drag, which occurs naturally,
    and teams design their cars to counter this effect to lose minimal time on straights. The other type of drag is induced, meaning it is created
    due to the team’s aerodynamic concepts applied to the car. As mentioned by Pandit, A. & Day, G. (2021), it is created by a pressure difference
    between the two ends of the body, as force acts from an area of high pressure to low pressure. Downforce, a force produced in the same direction
    as the weight, pushes the car into the ground by directing air away from it, enhancing cornering speed and stability.
</p>

<h3 id="Airfoil-Design">Airfoil Design</h3>
<p class="ex1">
    The base component of an aerodynamic object is called the airfoil, often derived from a teardrop shape. Due to its irregular form, air traveling
    over the upper surface of an airfoil travels a greater distance than that over the lower surface, increasing velocity. This difference causes
    a pressure differential, which engineers utilize to increase pressure across certain areas, optimizing downforce or reducing drag. The angle
    of attack, the angle at which the airfoil is positioned, determines how air is directed, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency.
</p>

<h3 id="Determining-the-angle-of-attack">Determining the Angle of Attack</h3>
<p class="ex1">
    Engineers face challenges in determining the angle of attack, as it involves trade-offs between downforce and drag. Increasing the angle of attack
    generates more downforce but also increases drag. Testing at different angles, as demonstrated in studies, reveals that a 12.5° angle of attack
    provides an optimal balance, producing significant downforce with manageable drag. This optimization enhances cornering performance while maintaining
    straight-line speed.
</p>

<h3 id="Deciding-when-and-where-to-use-different-angles-of-attack">Deciding When and Where to Use Different Angles of Attack</h3>
<p class="ex1">
    Engineers tailor aerodynamic settings to specific circuits. For instance, tracks like Monza prioritize minimal drag due to high-speed straights,
    favoring lower angles of attack. Conversely, tracks like Monaco require higher downforce and grip, utilizing higher angles for better cornering
    performance. This strategic flexibility is key to maximizing performance.
